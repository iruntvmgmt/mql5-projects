# Multi-Speed ZigZag Suite Decision Log

This file is append-only. Do not rewrite earlier decisions to make the history look cleaner. Supersede a decision with a new entry that references the old one.

## D001 — Standalone-first, reusable-core architecture

**Date:** 2026-07-25  
**Status:** Accepted

### Decision

Develop the Multi-Speed ZigZag system as a standalone EA and self-contained strategy suite, while keeping the structural engine and strategy logic reusable through a future Quant Beast adapter.

### Reason

The ZigZag concept supports many distinct hypotheses and requires independent research, parity validation, event clustering, and execution experiments. Embedding all of that directly into Quant Beast would increase coupling and interfere with active Quant Beast edge research.

### Consequences

- Primary front end: `MultiSpeedZigZagEA.mq5`.
- Quant Beast integration is deferred until the shared engine is validated.
- No duplicate strategy implementation is allowed between standalone and adapter modes.

## D002 — Dedicated branch and path isolation

**Date:** 2026-07-25  
**Status:** Accepted

### Decision

Use branch `feature/mszz-standalone-suite` and place new implementation and documentation under dedicated MSZZ paths.

### Reason

Claude is actively modifying Quant Beast on `main`. Path isolation reduces merge conflicts and accidental changes to active Quant Beast research.

### Consequences

- Existing indicator files are initially read-only behavioral references.
- Quant Beast files should not be modified during the initial standalone milestone.

## D003 — Documentation is a completion requirement

**Date:** 2026-07-25  
**Status:** Accepted

### Decision

A material code change is incomplete unless its architecture, behavior, test impact, and continuation state are documented in the same branch.

### Required updates

At least one of the following must change with each meaningful implementation change:

- `HANDOFF.md`
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `STRATEGY_CATALOG.md`
- `NON_REPAINTING_CONTRACT.md`
- `TEST_PLAN.md`
- this decision log

### Reason

Future agents must be able to continue from evidence and explicit decisions rather than reconstructing intent from code alone.
